    "This is a 72-hour challenge I did in late March 2022 for a data scientist position at an Indonesian multicompany, specifically at their media daughter company. The premise of the challenge is to recommend three to five apps from Google Playstore based on number of downloads, rating, and positive reviews. The constraint is the app must not be overly popular (e.g. Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook)."

    "I believe that recommendation should be given based on outstading performance, and that includes apps. However, that may be difficult for newly launched apps with small number of users as the app lacks exposure towards wider audience and may underperform against Application Search Optimization (ASO). I decided to take up the task of recommending users of new apps worth trying using sentiment analysis in Python on thousands of app reviews from 2010 to 2018, and write an article about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the task is to mutually benefit users and app developers. I hope to appeal to users through my data-backed recommendation that there are apps which are as functional as the more popular apps out there. With increased number of users, these apps will have more organic data for further development and generate revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "My recommendation will be based on a few KPI's of an app such as number of installs, reasonable number of positive reviews and average rating in the last thirty days."

    "This is an out of pocket observation, but I noticed this later on during data exploration phase. Observation #10472 is missing value for column `category`. Because of that, every other value has been shifted one column left its proper column. For example, column `category` is supposed to have a *string* value like `TOOLS`, but instead there is a *numeric* value of `1.9` where it would have made more sense to be under column `avg_rating`. I decided to drop that observation as it is not worth fixing."
